DISCLAIMER: This is not very well packaged code.  It's not packaged at
all.  Don't come here expecting something you plop in a directory,
twiddle a few things, and you're off and using it.

To set up the Alumni Internet Directory, you'll need to edit the
following things (and probably several more):

bin/generic_config.pl:
  copy this file to customize for your high school (change all GHS
  and Generic High School references to your own school)

bin/aid_util.pl:
  change the "require 'generic_config.pl'" line to your particular school

Makefile:
  SCHOOL, WWWROOT, WWWDIR, CGIDIR

data/*.include:
  [all text]

data/working.db:
  You'll need to create this file, but there's no script to do it
  automatically.  I'd suggest run these commands:
    $ perl -e 'dbmopen(%DB,"data/working",0666); dbmclose(%DB);'
    $ ./bin/aid_edit_entry data/working.db -1

  The first should create a valid, empty DBM file for your particular OS.
  The second will drop you into your favorite editor (vi by default)
  and let you create the first entry (probably your name!) by hand.
  Be sure to put non-blank values in the 4 required keys:
    * sn [surname]
    * gn [given name]
    * e [email address]
    * yr [graduation year]

After editing Makefile and the .pl configuration files appropriately, do
a 'make symlinks' to set up symbolic links from the web's cgi-bin
directory to the bin directory.

If you've successfully created a working.db file and done a 'make
symlinks', you should be able to do a 'make all' and actually get
something to work.

One more note -- 'make symlinks' will do this for you automatically, but
you should be aware of it if it fails for some reason -- if you're using
Apache and a directory other than cgi-bin for your binaries, you'll also
need to create a .htaccess file in your web's bin directory with this
directive:

  SetHandler cgi-script

If that doesn't work (or you're using another web server), you might
need to rename all of the cgi binaries with the extension .cgi.
