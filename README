DISCLAIMER: This is not very well packaged code.  It's not packaged at
all.  Don't come here expecting something you plop in a directory,
twiddle a few things, and you're off and using it.

To set up the Alumni Internet Directory, you'll need to edit the
following things (and probably several more):

cgi-bin/cgi-lib.pl:
  download a copy of cgi-lib.pl from http://cgi-lib.stanford.edu/cgi-lib/

bin/generic_config.pl:
  copy this file to customize for your high school (change all GHS
  and Generic High School references to your own school)

bin/aid_util.pl:
  change the "require 'generic_config.pl'" line to your particular school

Makefile:
  SCHOOL, WWWROOT, WWWDIR, CGIDIR

data/*.include:
  [all text]

data/master.adr:
  create a one-line file that looks like this:
1;1;Smith;;Jane;4;1;0;815137658;920508844;920508844;1;1993;jsmith@bogus-domain.org;;;;;0;


You'll probably want to remove the references to "Awalt" as well.

After editing Makefile and the .pl configuration files appropriately, do
a 'make symlinks' to set up symbolic links from the web's cgi-bin
directory to the bin directory.

If you're using Apache and a directory other than cgi-bin for your
binaries, you'll also need to create a .htaccess file in your web's bin
directory with this directive:

  SetHandler cgi-script

If that doesn't work (or you're using another web server), you might
need to rename all of the cgi binaries with the extension .cgi.
