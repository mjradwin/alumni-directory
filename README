DISCLAIMER: This is not very well packaged code.  It's not packaged at
all.  Don't come here expecting something you plop in a directory,
twiddle a few things, and you're off and using it.

To set up the Alumni Internet Directory, you'll need to edit the
following things (and probably several more):

bin/generic_config.pl:
  copy this file to customize for your high school (change all GHS
  and Generic High School references to your own school)

bin/aid_util.pl:
  change the "require 'generic_config.pl'" line to your particular school

Makefile:
  SCHOOL, WWWROOT, WWWDIR, CGIDIR

data/*.include:
  [all text]

data/working.db:
  You'll need to create this file, but there's no script to do it
  automatically.  I'd suggest you do a 'touch data/working.db' and then
  './bin/aid_edit_entry data/working.db -1' and edit yourself an entry
  (be sure to put non-blank values in the 4 required keys -- sn
  [surname], gn [given name], e [email address], yr [graduation year] or
  it won't work).

After editing Makefile and the .pl configuration files appropriately, do
a 'make symlinks' to set up symbolic links from the web's cgi-bin
directory to the bin directory.

If you've successfully created a working.db file and done a 'make
symlinks', you should be able to do a 'make all' and actually get
something to work.

'make symlinks' will do this, but you should be aware of it -- if you're
using Apache and a directory other than cgi-bin for your binaries,
you'll also need to create a .htaccess file in your web's bin directory
with this directive:

  SetHandler cgi-script

If that doesn't work (or you're using another web server), you might
need to rename all of the cgi binaries with the extension .cgi.
